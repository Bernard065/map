# map

The map() function in JavaScript is a higher-order function that is available for arrays. It's used to create a new array by applying a provided function to each element of the original array. The resulting array will have the same length as the original array, but each element will be transformed based on the function you provide.

Here's the syntax of the map() function:

```javascript
const newArray = array.map(callback(currentValue[, index[, array]]) {
  // Your code here
  // Return the transformed value
});
```
